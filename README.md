### REQUIRED UPDATE TO PLAY RANKED CVC

**You will no longer be able to use the Podcrash Launcher to play on PDC. You must use the default Minecraft Launcher or a 3rd-party launcher like ATLauncher or Prism.**

### INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the file for your system. (Probably Windows: `PDCFixer_windows.exe`)
2. Close the Minecraft Launcher if you have it open.
3. Run the file. If it is prevented from running click More Info and Run anyway. _This is due to the nature of what this program does, and we do not have Microsoft Certificates to verify these files. The source code is available on this repo._
4. A command prompt will open. Use the arrow keys to move down and press Enter on `1.8.9`, then `Optifine`, or `Forge` if you plan on using other mods along with Podcrash. Then type the amount of gigabytes of ram to allocate. `2` is recommended for lower-end machines, and `4` for mid to higher-end machines. 
5. Podcrash Play is now installed to your Minecraft Launcher. Open the Minecraft launcher and it should be automatically selected as the current instance. You can now click play and Podcrash should load as usual.
